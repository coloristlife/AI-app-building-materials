"Human-on-the-loop" is a variation of this pattern where human experts define the overarching policy, and the AI then handles immediate actions to ensure compliance.

The term “humans in the loop” refers to systems that require direct human involvement in making or approving decisions. Here, humans are an integral part of the process, stepping in to evaluate outcomes or resolve uncertainties.

In contrast, the “humans on the loop” approach positions humans as supervisors of automated systems. Instead of being directly involved in every decision, humans monitor processes and intervene only when necessary—typically when anomalies or edge cases arise.

"Human in the loop" (HITL) involves direct human participation in each decision, while "human on the loop" (HOTL) places humans in an oversight role who can intervene and override the system's autonomous actions when necessary.
