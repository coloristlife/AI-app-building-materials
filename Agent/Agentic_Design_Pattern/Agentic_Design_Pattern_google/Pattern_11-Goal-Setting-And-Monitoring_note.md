# Goal Setting and Monitoring 

For AI agents to be truly effective and purposeful, they need more than just the ability to process information or use tools; they need a clear sense of direction and a way to know if they're actually succeeding. This is where the Goal Setting and Monitoring pattern comes into play. It's about giving agents specific objectives to work towards and equipping them with the means to track their progress and determine if those objectives have been met.
