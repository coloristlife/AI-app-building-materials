The Short Version: The 12 Factors
Even if LLMs continue to get exponentially more powerful, there will be core engineering techniques that make LLM-powered software more reliable, more scalable, and easier to maintain.

How We Got Here: A Brief History of Software
Factor 1: Natural Language to Tool Calls
Factor 2: Own your prompts
Factor 3: Own your context window
Factor 4: Tools are just structured outputs
Factor 5: Unify execution state and business state
Factor 6: Launch/Pause/Resume with simple APIs
Factor 7: Contact humans with tool calls
Factor 8: Own your control flow
This pattern allows you to interrupt and resume your agent's flow as needed, creating more natural conversations and workflows.
Factor 9: Compact Errors into Context Window
Factor 10: Small, Focused Agents
Factor 11: Trigger from anywhere, meet users where they are
Factor 12: Make your agent a stateless reducer
