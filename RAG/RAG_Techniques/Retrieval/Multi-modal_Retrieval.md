https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques?tab=readme-ov-file (no implementation) 

Overview 🔎
Extending RAG capabilities to handle diverse data types for richer responses.

Implementation 🛠️
Multi-model RAG with Multimedia Captioning:   - Caption and store all the other multimedia data like pdfs, ppts, etc., with text data in vector store and retrieve them together.
Multi-model RAG with Colpali:   - Instead of captioning convert all the data into image, then find the most relevant images and pass them to a vision large language model.
