Figure 1:Tree construction process: RAPTOR recursively clusters chunks of text based on their vector embeddings and generates text summaries of those clusters, constructing a tree from the bottom up. Nodes clustered together are siblings; a parent node contains the text summary of that cluster.

Features

- Table Extraction: Identify and parse tables to retrieve structured data, making it easier to answer data-specific questions.
- Text Extraction: Efficiently extract and process text from PDFs, enabling accurate and comprehensive information retrieval.
- Image Analysis: Extract and interpret images within the PDFs to provide contextually relevant information.

Technologies Used
- LangChain: Framework for building applications with language models.
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Combines retrieval and generation for more accurate answers.
- RAPTOR: Constructs a recursive tree structure from documents for efficient, context-aware information retrieval.
- Streamlit: Framework for creating interactive web applications with Python.
- Unstructured.io: Tool for parsing and extracting complex content from PDFs, such as tables, graphs, and images.
- Poetry: Dependency management and packaging tool for Python.
