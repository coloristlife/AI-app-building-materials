**RAPTOR Overview and Problem Context**

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods augment language models with external knowledge by retrieving relevant document snippets. However, traditional RAG systems split documents into short contiguous chunks (e.g., fixed-length passages) and retrieve them via vector search. This approach often fails for complex queries requiring understanding across an entire document. For example, to answer *‚ÄúHow did Cinderella reach her happy ending?‚Äù*, isolated paragraphs may miss the full narrative.

**RAPTOR** (‚ÄúRecursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval‚Äù) solves this by building a **hierarchical summary tree** of each document, enabling multi-level retrieval. It first divides text into small chunks, then recursively clusters semantically similar chunks and summarizes each cluster into higher-level summaries. This bottom-up process constructs a **tree of summaries** that captures both detailed and abstracted content.

At query time, RAPTOR retrieves relevant nodes from this tree, providing context at the appropriate level of abstraction. It overcomes the RAG limitation of ‚Äúshort contiguous snippets only‚Äù by indexing documents at multiple scales. The recursive summarization allows efficient integration of information across an entire document.

**Main Components of RAPTOR**

**RAPTOR‚Äôs pipeline** includes the following stages:

* **Chunking:** Split each document into short contiguous segments (‚âà100 tokens) while preserving sentence integrity. Each chunk becomes a leaf node in the RAPTOR tree.
* **Embedding:** Encode each chunk with a vector model (e.g., SBERT). These embeddings are inputs for clustering.
* **Clustering:** Group semantically related chunks using an embedding-based algorithm. RAPTOR employs a **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** on reduced-dimension embeddings (via UMAP) for soft clustering, allowing a chunk to belong to multiple clusters if it spans topics. The **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)** selects the number of clusters. Clustering is hierarchical: broad global clusters first, then finer local ones. Oversized clusters are recursively split until manageable.
* **Summarization:** For each cluster, a language model (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo) produces an abstractive summary. Summaries form the internal nodes of the tree, with member chunks as children. Summaries are ~72% shorter than the original text, reducing context size while retaining key content. Only ~4% of summaries have minor hallucinations, with negligible downstream impact.
* **Recursive Tree Construction:** Summaries are re-embedded, clustered, and summarized again. This recursive process builds a multi-layer tree‚Äîroot nodes encode overall themes, intermediate nodes represent mid-level topics, and leaves hold fine details.

**Retrieval Strategies:**
At query time, RAPTOR supports two methods:

* **Tree Traversal:** Start at the root, select top-ùëò nodes by cosine similarity, then descend recursively to child nodes.
* **Collapsed Tree:** Flatten all nodes and select the top ones globally under a token budget.

Empirically, **collapsed retrieval** performs best since it flexibly mixes high-level and detailed context.

**Recursive Summarization and Embedding-Based Clustering**

The core innovation in RAPTOR is **recursive abstractive summarization**. The process alternates between clustering and summarizing:

1. **Cluster leaf embeddings:** Using SBERT and GMM+UMAP, semantically coherent clusters are formed (based on meaning, not text order).
2. **Summarize each cluster:** An LLM generates a concise abstract for each cluster‚Äôs combined text, encapsulating its shared themes.
3. **Embed summaries:** These are treated as new ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù and re-embedded.
4. **Repeat clustering:** The summaries are clustered and summarized recursively until all content is captured in a top-level summary.

Each level compresses its children by ~72%, resulting in a compact tree that preserves the document‚Äôs semantic structure. The final hierarchy encodes both high-level and fine-grained knowledge.

---

**Query-Time Retrieval from the Tree**

When given a query, RAPTOR embeds it using the same encoder and retrieves relevant nodes from the summary tree.

* **Tree Traversal:** Navigate top-down from root to leaves, selecting top-ùëò nodes at each level by similarity. This balances breadth and depth.
* **Collapsed Tree:** Flatten all nodes and select the most similar ones globally until the token limit is reached.

**Collapsed retrieval** typically outperforms traversal because it selects the optimal mix of summaries and detailed chunks. Efficient similarity search libraries like FAISS can accelerate this step.

Example: In the *Cinderella* experiment, RAPTOR retrieves multi-level nodes capturing the full storyline, while flat DPR retrieval only captures disjoint paragraphs. RAPTOR‚Äôs retrieved context usually includes or surpasses DPR‚Äôs, with greater semantic coverage.

**Comparison to Traditional RAG (Flat Retrieval)**

| **Aspect**                 | **Traditional RAG**           | **RAPTOR**                                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Context Scope**          | Retrieves fixed-length chunks | Retrieves summaries and chunks at multiple granularities |
| **Thematic Grouping**      | Contiguous text only          | Semantic clustering across distant segments              |
| **Retrieval Granularity**  | Uniform chunks                | Multi-scale (summary or detail based on query)           |
| **Compression Efficiency** | All chunks stored equally     | Summaries compress info (~72% token reduction)           |
| **Interpretability**       | Flat and opaque               | Hierarchical, showing which clusters were retrieved      |
| **Computation Trade-off**  | Simple but shallow            | Heavier preprocessing, better retrieval accuracy         |

**Trade-offs:**
RAPTOR requires more preprocessing‚Äîrepeated clustering and LLM summarization‚Äîbut scales linearly with document length and delivers superior retrieval quality. Query-time search is heavier but manageable with optimization. The 4% hallucination rate has minimal effect. Overall, RAPTOR trades computation for **significant improvements in accuracy, context quality, and interpretability**.

---

**Empirical Benefits and Insights**

Experiments show that RAPTOR consistently outperforms flat retrieval across benchmarks like **NarrativeQA, QASPER,** and **QuALITY**:

* On QASPER, RAPTOR improves F1 by **1.8‚Äì10.2 points** over DPR/BM25 baselines.
* On QuALITY, RAPTOR with UnifiedQA achieves **62.4% accuracy**, a **2‚Äì5% absolute gain**.
* Gains are most pronounced in complex, reasoning-heavy questions.

RAPTOR also enhances interpretability: retrieved nodes clearly trace the evidence chain, showing both high-level and detailed contributions. The recursive summaries reduce memory usage (~72% fewer tokens per level) while maintaining accuracy.

**Implementation and Integration:**
RAPTOR is available as a **Python library** with a simple interface:

```python
RA = RetrievalAugmentation()
RA.add_documents(text)
answer = RA.answer_question(question)
```

The system is modular‚Äîdevelopers can replace embedding or summarization models via subclassing (e.g., swap SBERT or GPT).

RAPTOR is also integrated into **RAGFlow** as a preprocessing option, highlighting its practical adoption for enterprise-scale retrieval systems.

---

**In Summary**

RAPTOR introduces a **recursive, hierarchical approach** to document retrieval that captures multi-scale structure and meaning. It delivers more **accurate, efficient, and interpretable retrieval** than traditional RAG systems by combining clustering, summarization, and multi-level embeddings into a single, coherent framework.
