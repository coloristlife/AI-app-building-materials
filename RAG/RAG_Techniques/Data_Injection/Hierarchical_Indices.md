What Are Hierarchical Indices?
Hierarchical indices are a way of organizing information in a multi-level structure. Here‚Äôs a basic breakdown of a 3-tier level structure:

1. Top-Level Summaries: Brief overviews of entire documents or large data sections.
2. Mid-Level Overviews: More detailed summaries of subsections.
3. Detailed Chunks: Specific, granular pieces of information.

This structure allows for more efficient and context-aware information retrieval
