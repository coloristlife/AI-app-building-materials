Overview 🔎
This implementation demonstrates a text augmentation technique that leverages additional question generation to improve document retrieval within a vector database. By generating and incorporating various questions related to each text fragment, the system enhances the standard retrieval process, thus increasing the likelihood of finding relevant documents that can be utilized as context for generative question answering.

Implementation 🛠️
Use an LLM to augment text dataset with all possible questions that can be asked to each document
