## Centrality and Importance

Centrality algorithms are used to determine the importance of distinct nodes in a graph.

Common use cases of centrality include:

- Recommendations: Identify and recommend the most influential or popular items in your content or product offering catalog

- Supply chain analytics: find the most critical node in your supply chain, whether it be a supplier in a network, a raw material that is part of a manufactured product, or a port in a route

- Fraud & Anomaly Detection: Find users with many shared identifiers or who otherwise act as a bridge between many communities
