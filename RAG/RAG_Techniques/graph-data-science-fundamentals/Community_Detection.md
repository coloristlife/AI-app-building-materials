# Community Detection

Community detection algorithms are used to evaluate how groups of nodes may be clustered or partitioned in the graph. Much of the community detection functionality in GDS is focused on distinguishing and assigning ids to these node groups for downstream analytics, visualization, or other processing.

Common use cases of community detection include:

  - Fraud detection: Finding fraud rings by identifying accounts that have frequent suspicious transactions and/or share identifiers between one another.
  
  - Customer 360: Disambiguating multiple records and interactions into a single customer profile so an organization has an aggregated source of truth for each customer.
  
  - Market segmentation: dividing a target market into approachable subgroups based on priorities, behaviors, interests, and other criteria.
