## Graph RAG 
Graph RAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Graph RAG extends RAG by incorporating knowledge graphs into the retrieval process. Instead of retrieving only text chunks, Graph RAG indexes data into a graph structure of entities (nodes) and relationships (edges). This graph-based retrieval enables multi-hop reasoning across connected facts and often pairs graph queries with vector search. Graph RAG has proven effective for complex queries that require linking disparate pieces of information (e.g., answering questions on citation networks or social graphs) and can significantly outperform naive RAG in multi-step reasoning tasks. Microsoft’s GraphRAG project is a notable example, which automatically constructs a knowledge graph from text documents and supports hierarchical community detection for “global” insights.

The user intent agent is a goal-oriented, conversational agent that helps the user ideate on the kind of graph to build.
The File Suggestion agent is a tool-use agent that suggests files to use for import, based on the approved user goal from the previous lesson.
