# 🍎 Picking Apples: Learning About Precision, Recall, and F1 Score

Imagine you have a basket with **20 apples** and **10 other fruits**—so **30 fruits in total**. Your job is to grab **only the apples**. How do you know if you’re doing a good job? That’s where **precision, recall, and F1 score** come in!

---

### 1. Precision: “Did I pick the right fruits?”

* You grab **10 fruits**, and **7 of them are apples**.
* **Precision** = Apples you picked ÷ Total fruits you picked = 7 ÷ 10 = **70%**

💡 Kid version: “Out of all the fruits I grabbed, 70% were actually apples.”

---

### 2. Recall: “Did I grab most of the apples?”

* There are **20 apples** in the basket, and you grabbed **7**.
* **Recall** = Apples you picked ÷ Total apples in basket = 7 ÷ 20 = **35%**

💡 Kid version: “I only grabbed 35% of the apples in the basket.”

---

### 3. F1 Score: “How good am I overall?”

* F1 combines **precision** and **recall**:
  [
  F1 = 2 \times \frac{0.7 \times 0.35}{0.7 + 0.35} \approx 0.47 , (47%)
  ]

💡 Kid version: “Overall, I’m 47% good at grabbing apples correctly AND not missing too many.”

| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Precision | How many of the fruits you grabbed are actually apples?                         |
| Recall    | How many of the apples in the basket did you grab?                              |
