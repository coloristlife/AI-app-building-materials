ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation), is a set of metrics and a software package specifically designed for evaluating automatic summarization, but that can be also used for machine translation. The metrics compare an automatically produced summary or translation against reference (high-quality and human-produced) summaries or translations.

In general:

- BLEU focuses on precision: how much the words (and/or n-grams) in the candidate model outputs appear in the human reference.
- ROUGE focuses on recall: how much the words (and/or n-grams) in the human references appear in the candidate model outputs.
